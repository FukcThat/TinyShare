# TinyShare Roadmap

### Todos:

-[19] Host on Netlify

### Issues

- Inconsistent/not working realtime behaviour in the booking calendar. Will be easier to debug once hosted
- Inconsistent/not working realtime behaviour in the dashboard item list view
- Non-active community item issue
- Accepting a booking; local update doesn't work (real time technically does)

### Styling / UX Issues

- Item Availability toggle through button instead edit form (Item Page)
- Dark Mode:
  -- System Default
  -- Local Storage
- Change Admin Toggle needs to be clearer (Community Page)
- Add who sent an invite to a community (Admin Panel, Community Page)
- Bring back Active Community DropDown
- Pending item requests (concering user) are visible
- Own Item Page & Dashboard Footer gap (bottom)
- Notification Modal to replace actionable things
