Current Commit:
FEAT: show pending requests, actionable events notification panel, navbar icons

### Todos:
- Notification Modal/Icon to replace actionable events:
-- Invited to new community
-- One of your items has a pending request

- Lives in Navbar
- if we have an active community invite, or a pending request on our items, show a number badge
- when click open modal below showing small details panels
- community invite with accept/decline
- item reservation request with confirm/deny or link to item page
- Make most navbar items into icons for UX
