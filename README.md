# TinyShare Roadmap

### Todos:
- when we enter the item page, we should query that specific item if it is not in our items nor in the active community items

### Issues
- Inconsistent/not working realtime behaviour in the booking calendar. Will be easier to debug once hosted
- Inconsistent/not working realtime behaviour in the dashboard item list view
- Non-active community item issue
- Accepting a booking; local update doesn't work (real time technically does)

### Styling / UX Issues
- Item Availability toggle through button instead edit form (Item Page)
- Change Admin Toggle needs to be clearer (Community Page)
- Bring back Active Community DropDown
- Pending item requests (concering user) are visible
- Notification Modal to replace actionable things

### Future Features
--[] I18N
--[] Style Update
